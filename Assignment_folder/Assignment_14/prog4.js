4) what is binary search tree
Binary Tree: It is a binary tree, meaning that each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child.

Ordered Structure: In a binary search tree, for each node:

All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value.
All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
This property holds recursively for each node and its descendants, making it an ordered structure.
