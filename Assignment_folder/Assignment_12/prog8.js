what is a constructor?
ans:
In JavaScript, a constructor is a special type of function that is used to create and initialize objects created with the new keyword. Constructors are typically used to define and initialize properties and methods for objects that belong to a particular class or type.

When a constructor function is invoked with the new keyword, it creates a new instance of an object and sets the value of this to refer to that newly created object. Within the constructor function, you can define properties and methods that will be associated with each instance of the object.

Here's an example of a constructor function in JavaScript:
function Person(firstName, lastName, age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;

    this.fullName = function() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    };
}

// Create instances of Person using the constructor function
let person1 = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);
let person2 = new Person("Jane", "Smith", 25);

console.log(person1.fullName()); // Output: "John Doe"
console.log(person2.fullName()); // Output: "Jane Smith"
