Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that regardless of where variables and functions are declared within their scope, they are treated as if they are declared at the top of that scope.

Hoisting affects variable declarations and function declarations differently:

Variable Declarations:

When a variable is declared using var, let, or const, the declaration is hoisted to the top of its containing scope. However, only the declaration (not the initialization) is hoisted.
If you try to access a variable before its declaration, JavaScript will not throw an error, but the variable will have the value undefined.

ex:
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
var myVar = 10;

This code behaves as if it were written like this:
var myVar;
console.log(myVar);
myVar = 10;

Function Declarations:

Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning both the declaration and the function definition are moved to the top of their containing scope.
This allows you to call a function before its actual declaration in the code without encountering any errors.

ex:
myFunction(); // Output: "Hello, world!"
function myFunction() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}


This code behaves as if it were written like this:

function myFunction() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
myFunction();


However, it's important to note that hoisting only applies to declarations, not initializations or assignments. For example, if you initialize a variable after its usage, it will still retain the value assigned to it at the initialization point, not undefined. This is because only the declaration of the variable is hoisted, not its value assignment.

Understanding hoisting is crucial for writing clean and predictable JavaScript code. It's recommended to declare variables at the beginning of their scope and avoid relying on hoisting to prevent confusion and potential bugs.
