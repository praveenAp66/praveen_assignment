 What are member variables?
In JavaScript, the term "member variables" is not used in the same way as in traditional object-oriented programming languages like Java or C++. However, the concept of member variables can still be understood within the context of JavaScript objects.

In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs where the keys are strings (or Symbols) and the values can be of any data type, including other objects, functions, or primitive values like strings, numbers, and booleans. These key-value pairs are often referred to as properties of the object.

When we talk about member variables in JavaScript, we are typically referring to the properties of an object that hold data associated with that object. These properties can be defined within the object literal notation, added or modified dynamically, or inherited from a prototype object.


ans:
// Object literal notation
let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false
};

// Accessing member variables
console.log(person.firstName); // Output: "John"
console.log(person.age); // Output: 30

// Modifying member variables
person.age = 35;
console.log(person.age); // Output: 35


In this example, firstName, lastName, age, and isStudent are the member variables (or properties) of the person object. They hold data associated with the person object, such as the person's name, age, and student status. These member variables can be accessed and modified using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object["property"]).

It's important to note that in JavaScript, objects are dynamic, meaning you can add, modify, or remove properties at runtime. This flexibility allows for powerful and expressive programming but also requires careful consideration when designing and manipulating objects in your code.
