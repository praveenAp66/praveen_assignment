6. how to iterate throgh an object explain?
object is used to store anykind of data,data are stored in an key value pair
we can iterate over an object through key 
for ex:
let object={
    name:"praveen";
    age:23;
    gender:"male"
}
data are stored in an key value pair so that we can iterate using key value with an object name
ex:to find the age
console.log(object.age);
